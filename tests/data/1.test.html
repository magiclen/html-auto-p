Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, and provides memory safety without using garbage collection.

Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language while writing the Servo layout or browser engine, and the Rust compiler. The compiler is free and open-source software dual-licensed under the MIT License and Apache License 2.0.

Rust has been the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016.
