Rust is intended to be a language for highly concurrent and highly safe systems, and programming in the large, that is, creating and maintaining boundaries that preserve large-system integrity. This has led to a feature set with an emphasis on safety, control of memory layout, and concurrency.
<h2>Performance of idiomatic Rust</h2>
